# DensityAltitudeCalculator
This was my very first programming project, in MATLAB. It is an aerospace-focused program that calculates the local density altitude and confirms if it is safe for the pilot to fly that day.


[Here's the PDF to this project! I scored 50/50.](https://github.com/mccnick/DensityAltitudeCalculator/blob/main/Nick%20McCullough%20-%20Project%201.pdf)
